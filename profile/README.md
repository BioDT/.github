## Guidelines for naming new repositories

- Use lower-case letters where possible.
- General-use features identified by adding `general` to the beginning of the repository name, e.g. `general-datamover`.
- Use case-specific code similarly identified by `uc` and the name of the UC, e.g. `uc-grassland`.

Separate features (such as individual digital twin components) may be kept in folders inside a given repository. In case it is preferable to create a separate repository for a feature, the name of the feature should be added to the end of the repository name (e.g. `uc-grassland-feature1`).

### Use Case names for use in repositories

List updated as new repositories are created.

- Grassland dynamics: `uc-grassland`
- Honey bee dynamics: `uc-beehave`
